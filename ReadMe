Abstract:
    The purpose of this demo program is to illustrate a robust method of
    data fitting convenient for dealing with astrophysical spectra
    contaminated by a large fraction of outliers.

    We base our approach on the suitable defined measure - the density of
    the least-squares (DLS) which characterize subsets of the whole data
    set. The best-fit parameters are obtained by the least-squares method
    on a subset having the maximum value of DLS or, less formally, on the
    largest subset subset free of outliers.

    Due to its simplicity and robustness, the proposed approach could be a
    method of choice for some common tasks like estimation of continuum in
    the presence of spectral lines and estimation of spectral line
    parameters in the presence of outliers. See full paper for details
    regarding the estimation of the thermodynamic temperature from the
    spectrum rich in spectral lines.

Description:
    Simple FORTRAN90 Demo of a complete program that uses DLSFIT routine
    (Bukvic, Spasojevic, and Zigman) for robust data fitting.

    The program consists of:
        1) main program: DLSFIT_AA_Demo
        2) subroutine DLSFIT, which performs DSL data fitting,
        3) subroutine fit - WLS "working engine" for DLSFIT,
        4) copyright protected FORTRAN77 subroutines: mrqmin, mrqcof, lfit,
            covsrt, gaussj, zbrent from: Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77:
            The Art of Scientific Computing, by Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S.A.,
            Vetterling, W.T., and Flannery, B.P.,
            Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001, software version 2.10:
            available on WEB site: http//www.nr.com

    Tested with Compaq Visual Fortran 6.6 and Intel 9.1 compilers.
    Should be compiled with REAL(8) as default real kind.

    Explanation of DLSFIT subroutine calling list:
    ----------------------------------------------

    The user supplies to DLSFIT subroutine a set of n0 experimental data points
    x(1:n0), y(1:n0), with individual standard deviations sig(1:n0) of their
    y_i's; if sig(1:n0) are not available, then set all sig(i)=1 prior to
    DLSFIT call. The next argument in DLSFIT calling list is array a(1:m) of
    length m. On input, the user supplies initial values of model function
    parameters in a(1:m) in the case when the model function is a non-linear
    function of its parameters; otherwise, the input values supplied in a(1:m)
    are irrelevant. On output, the main result of DLS method - the best-fit
    parameters associated with the best subset - are returned in a(1:m).


    The input parameter rp is the removal parameter. According to our
    experience, when 0.9<rp<=1 the best-fit parameters returned for different
    values of rp coincide within the error margins.

    Six parameters (chisq, dls, db, ns, spos, sbno) which follow in DLSFIT
    calling list are output parameters. Thus, chisq is chi-square and dls is
    the density of least-squares obtained on the best subset in the ordered
    collection C, found by DLSFIT, while db is the width of the best subset.
    Additionally, ns is the total number of subsets in C, spos(1:ns) is an
    integer array which contains the number of data points in each subset from
    C, and sbno is the ordinal number of the best subset in C.

    Note well that the arrays x(1:n0), y(1:n0) and sig(1:n0) are reordered on
    output so that the first spos(i) data points belong to the subset s_i in C.
    In this way, the user can obtain relevant data for each subset s_ in C by
    applying the OLS method on the first spos(i) elements of arrays x, y, and
    sig.

    The next three parameters covar, ia, funcs) in the calling list of the
    DLSFIT subroutine are specific to the applied lfit and mrqmin
    NR subroutines. Thus, covar(1:m,1:m) is a two-dimensional array, which on
    output contains the elements of covariance matrix. The integer array
    ia(1:m) provides a convenient way to keep some of the parameters frozen on
    their input values (ia(j)=0 for frozen a(j), otherwise ia(j) is non-zero);
    the values of all frozen parameters must be supplied on input in array a.
    Finally, funcs is the name of a user supplied subroutine (fpoly from NR in
    the case of polynomial fit) proceeded to DLSFIT when DLSFIT is called; when
    a general-linear fit is performed, then funcs(x,afunc,m) should return the
    m basis functions evaluated at x in the array afunc(1:m). In the opposite
    case funcs is a user supplied subroutine having syntax funcs(x,a,y,dyda,m).
    For given x and model function parameters a, supplied in array a(1:m) of
    length m, it returns the calculated value f(x;a) of model function in
    variable y, together with values of all model function partial derivatives,
    returned in array dyda(1:m).

    The last three parameters in DLSFIT calling list are lf, k, and res. The
    first of them, lf, is a LOGICAL input parameter. When lf is set to .TRUE.,
    then DLSFIT performs general-linear WLS data fitting by calling lfit
    subroutine; otherwise, non-linear fit is performed with an aid of mrqmin
    subroutine. The value of DLS exponent k is supplied to DLSFIT subroutine in
    the second parameter of the group, k. Finally, we must also supply the
    value of d_{max} (or delta_{max}) used in DLS calculations in the
    indefinite case. This is supplied through parameter res - the original
    resolution of measurement.
